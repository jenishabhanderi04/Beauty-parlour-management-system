Together, the treatments may be known as a mani-pedi. Most nail polish can stay on nails for 2â€“3 days before another manicure is required for maintenance, if there is no damage done to it.</h5>

New hair will not grow back in the previously waxed area for four to six weeks, although some people will start to see regrowth in only a week due to some of their hair being on a different human hair growth cycle. Almost any area of the body can be waxed, including eyebrows, face, pubic hair (called bikini waxing or intimate waxing), legs, arms, back, abdomen, chest, knuckles, and feet. There are many types of waxing suitable for removing unwanted hair.</h5>
